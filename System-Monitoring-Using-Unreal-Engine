Rethinking Network Security: Why Our Monitoring Tools Are Failing Us
Behavior Driven, Headless System Monitoring Using Unreal Engine AC

Version: 1.0
    1. Executive Summary
What do you do when your network is under attack?
How long does it take to detect it? Seconds, minutes, hours?
And when you finally respond‚Ä¶ is it already too late?
Today‚Äôs security stack is built for hindsight.
Logs. Alerts. Forensics. Damage assessments.
By the time most systems raise an alert, the breach is already done:
the database is gone, the ransomware is locked in, and the attacker has moved on.
This blueprint is about breaking that cycle.
I am proposing a new class of system; not passive, not reactive, but real time and behavior driven.
A system built to act before the breach.
With agents that respond in milliseconds.
A control plane that enforces your policies but stays out of your way.
Tooling that‚Äôs fast, explainable, and rooted in technologies we already trust.
The pages ahead outline the how:
‚Ä¢ A high level design that makes action, not just observation, the default
‚Ä¢ A distributed agent model tuned for speed, locality, and autonomy
‚Ä¢ A command architecture that favors transparency and human override
‚Ä¢ Techniques to reduce false positives and increase explainability in the moment, not after
We live on networks under constant pressure: bots, zero days, and adversaries who never rest.
Our defenses must match that intensity.
They need to be just as persistent. Just as adaptive. Just as alive.
This isn‚Äôt something I can work on alone and I would rather see it live under someone else direction than see it never made a reality.
It‚Äôs an open source blueprint dropped into the public domain a technical foundation meant to be picked up, shaped, and built upon. There‚Äôs no code to clone. No team to join. Just a challenge:
Build what should already exist. Because if we want to have save networks; the right time to act is now.
2. Background & Motivation
This monitoring architecture has been on the drawing board since 2011, when it was first conceptualized as a modular, intelligent alternative to rigid monitoring scripts and tools. At the time, the idea was viable in theory but difficult to execute alone primarily due to scope, tooling maturity, and the need for a multidisciplinary team to bring it to life.
That hasn't changed. The project remains intentionally large in scope and inherently collaborative. It was never meant to be a one person effort, and still isn‚Äôt. The goal is to release the blueprint publicly now because:
    ‚Ä¢ The underlying technology (e.g. Unreal Engine‚Äôs headless behavior trees, Linux observability tooling) is finally mature enough to support it reliably
    ‚Ä¢ The vision still holds: building a transparent, deterministic, and scalable system that responds intelligently to real world system conditions
    ‚Ä¢ There is intrinsic value in seeing the idea executed even if it‚Äôs not led by its originator
This whitepaper is being published to share the concept fully and clearly, to credit its origin, and to help guide anyone who wants to build on it whether as a team, a community project, or an open source initiative.
3. Problem Context
Modern systems whether cloud based, on premises, or hybrid require monitoring solutions that are both responsive and context aware. However, most existing tools fall into two categories, each with fundamental limitations that make them unsuitable for the type of intelligent, mission critical monitoring this project proposes.
üîπ Traditional Tools (Nagios, cron scripts, shell based monitors)
Traditional solutions typically rely on static, predefined conditions such as:
    ‚Ä¢ Disk space thresholds
    ‚Ä¢ CPU/memory utilization alerts
    ‚Ä¢ Cron jobs checking file changes or log entries
    ‚Ä¢ Hardcoded user activity rules (e.g., "if failed logins > 5, send email")
These tools are:
    ‚Ä¢ Blind to intent or context A failed login at 3:00 PM from a developer‚Äôs IP is not the same as a failed login at 2:00 AM from an unknown region. Yet both would trigger the same alert.
    ‚Ä¢ Prone to alert fatigue Static rule based systems generate excessive false positives and repeated alerts, desensitizing administrators to real threats.
    ‚Ä¢ Hard to scale or adapt Adding new rules or handling cross domain conditions (e.g., ‚Äúalert if login failure and unusual file access in /etc/‚Äù) requires manual logic stitching.
    ‚Ä¢ Siloed Traditional monitors operate independently, often duplicating effort or missing the larger picture due to lack of shared context or coordination.
üîπ Machine Learning & LLM Based Approaches
Recent trends have explored applying machine learning especially large language models (LLMs) to system monitoring, anomaly detection, and log analysis. While promising in exploratory or forensic settings, these models are fundamentally ill suited for real time infrastructure defense. They introduce:
    ‚Ä¢ Latency Model inference takes milliseconds to seconds, introducing delay in critical response loops.
    ‚Ä¢ Unpredictability ML driven conclusions can shift based on model drift, retraining datasets, or even input formatting.
    ‚Ä¢ Lack of determinism In regulated or mission critical environments, every action must be explainable and reproducible. LLMs cannot provide guaranteed, interpretable reasoning for decisions.
    ‚Ä¢ Resource bloat Running inference engines on production servers adds unnecessary CPU/GPU overhead and increases operational complexity.
    ‚Ä¢ Opaque logic Security teams need systems that behave like tools, not oracles. LLMs can hallucinate or generalize beyond safe bounds.
The result is a monitoring landscape split between brittle legacy tools and over engineered AC integrations neither of which deliver the speed, precision, or reliability required for active defense.
4. Rethinking Monitoring: From Scripts to Simulations
Instead of static scripts or probabilistic models, the proposed framework approaches system monitoring as an interactive, agent based simulation, closer in spirit to how AC learns to play games than how most enterprise software is built.
This idea draws inspiration from reinforcement learning systems popularized in platforms like Unity ML Agents and visualized through creators such as Code Bullet, where digital agents explore, react, fail, and improve within simulated environments.
Agent Intelligence, Not Artificial General Intelligence
Each agent in this framework represents a specialized unit like a digital NPC tasked with patrolling a specific domain: SSH logins, firewall rules, file integrity, system processes, or network I/O. These agents are:
    ‚Ä¢ Modular and lightweight, running only when needed.
    ‚Ä¢ Context aware, maintaining short term memory of user behaviors and patterns.
    ‚Ä¢ Deterministic, meaning they don‚Äôt make unexplainable decisions.
    ‚Ä¢ Human guided, never autonomously approving unknown behaviors.
Intervention Based Learning
When an agent encounters something unfamiliar say, an off hours login from finance it doesn't guess. It blocks the action temporarily, logs the context, and alerts the administrator via the MCP (Master Control Program).
The admin can then:
    ‚Ä¢ Allow once
    ‚Ä¢ Whitelist the behavior
    ‚Ä¢ Investigate and deny
This feedback loop enables the agent to "learn" with human reinforcement, ensuring security policies evolve with the environment without losing control, speed, or transparency.
The Simulation Loop
Internally, the MCP and agents operate much like a fast game loop:
    ‚Ä¢ Environment step: system signals flow in (new process, modified file, login attempt)
    ‚Ä¢ Perception: agents analyze inputs against current policy and memory
    ‚Ä¢ Decision: threat? unknown? allowed?
    ‚Ä¢ Action: block, allow, escalate
    ‚Ä¢ Feedback: logs + admin approval update internal state and whitelist
This approach makes the monitoring system both reactive and adaptive without relying on neural networks or traditional ML infrastructure.
5. Architecture Overview
The proposed system operates as a distributed agent framework governed by a centralized Master Control Program (MCP). Inspired by simulation game loops and agent based modeling, the architecture emphasizes real time response, modularity, and human centered oversight.
Core Components
MCP (Master Control Program)
The MCP is the command and control hub of the system. It is responsible for:
    ‚Ä¢ Receiving and aggregating reports from all agents
    ‚Ä¢ Alerting administrators on threats, unknown behavior, or failed policy checks
    ‚Ä¢ Distributing tasks to agents dynamically based on context
    ‚Ä¢ Maintaining a system wide state model of recent activities
    ‚Ä¢ Acting as the interface between system behavior and human decisions
Although it may be visualized in game like terms (Unreal Engine, Unity, or C++ simulation loop), the MCP itself is not dependent on a specific engine. Its core behavior is similar to a scheduler combined with a state manager and UI frontend.
Agents
Each agent is an independent module, plugin, or lightweight process responsible for monitoring a single domain of system activity. For example:
Agent
Monitors
Example Triggers
SSHMonitor
Auth logs, login behavior
Off hours access, failed brute force
NetWatch
Network traffic, IP sessions
Data exfiltration, beaconing patterns
FileSentinel
Filesystem events
Modifications to /etc/, tampered binaries
ProcGuardian
Processes, forks, unusual child patterns
Sudden spikes in CPU usage, hidden forks
CronWatch
Scheduled jobs, timing anomalies
New crontabs, unapproved script execution
Each agent follows a modular behavior tree, which defines:
    ‚Ä¢ What to watch
    ‚Ä¢ What counts as abnormal
    ‚Ä¢ What actions to take (block, alert, etc.)
    ‚Ä¢ How to escalate to the MCP
Agents wake up only when relevant events occur (e.g., via inotify, netfilter hooks, auditd triggers), conserving CPU and reducing monitoring overhead.
Plugin System
Agents are written as plugins (or hot swappable modules) and can be dynamically loaded, unloaded, or upgraded by the MCP. This design:
    ‚Ä¢ Enables rapid development and deployment of new detection strategies
    ‚Ä¢ Keeps the core system lightweight and focused
    ‚Ä¢ Allows for agent specific permissions, reducing blast radius on compromise
Logs & Whitelist Model
Agents log all activity to structured files (typically JSON), e.g.:
{
  "timestamp": "2025 06 16T03:24:18Z",
  "agent": "SSHMonitor",
  "event": {
    "type": "login_attempt",
    "username": "dsmith",
    "source_ip": "203.0.113.14",
    "result": "blocked",
    "reason": "off hours access outside 8AM 6PM"
  },
  "action_taken": "blocked",
  "requires_admin": true
}
These logs serve multiple purposes:
    ‚Ä¢ Real time visibility into what each agent is doing
    ‚Ä¢ Replayable audit trail
    ‚Ä¢ Source for generating automated whitelists through administrator feedback
The whitelist system is never automatic. Approval must come from the admin via MCP review. This keeps the system deterministic and auditable.
Communication Model
    ‚Ä¢ Agents send events and logs ‚Üí MCP (via socket, shared memory, or local IPC)
    ‚Ä¢ MCP aggregates, evaluates, and visualizes
    ‚Ä¢ If escalation is needed, MCP sends alert ‚Üí Admin
    ‚Ä¢ Admin response (allow, deny, ignore) is fed back into MCP and agents
This loop runs continuously, with each component working semi autonomously while staying orchestrated through MCP governance.
Deployment Footprint
The system is OS native, designed to run directly on Linux based systems without virtualization. Key characteristics:
    ‚Ä¢ Agents run as low privilege services or kernel hooks
    ‚Ä¢ MCP runs as a user space process with secure IPC channels
    ‚Ä¢ No cloud dependencies, no runtime ML models, no external telemetry
    ‚Ä¢ Capable of running on headless servers, IoT devices, or hybrid environments
    1. Example Agent Behavior: SSHMonitor & FileSentinel
Each agent operates using a lightweight, event driven behavior tree a structured, modular decision tree defining what the agent observes, how it evaluates it, and what actions it takes. These behaviors are deterministic, auditable, and human tunable. The goal is not "learning," but repeatable decision logic with optional human approval.
SSHMonitor Agent
This agent observes all SSH related activity across the system, including logins, failed attempts, user behavior, and access times.
Trigger: SSH login attempt detected via log watcher or PAM hook
Behavior Tree:
Event: SSH Login Attempt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check if user is in allowed list
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Block + Alert MCP
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check if access is during approved time window
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Block + Alert MCP
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check source IP against known IP ranges
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Known ‚Üí Allow
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unknown ‚Üí Hold + Request admin review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Count login failures from same IP
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ >3 in 60s ‚Üí Temp ban IP (fail2ban style)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚â§3 ‚Üí Log only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Record event:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Timestamp
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Source IP
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Outcome (Allowed, Blocked, Flagged)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Confidence level
The agent never assumes intent. If something is unknown, it errs on the side of caution and asks permission via the MCP before allowing the session.
FileSentinel Agent
This agent monitors critical filesystem paths (/etc, /usr/bin, /home, etc.) for unauthorized changes, tampering, or unknown access patterns.
Trigger: File modification, creation, or deletion in monitored paths
Behavior Tree:
Event: Filesystem Change Detected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Match path against whitelist
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Match ‚Üí Ignore
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No match ‚Üí Continue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Is the file in a critical directory (e.g., /etc/systemd)?
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí High threat score
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Medium threat score
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identify the process that caused the change
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Known process (e.g., apt, systemctl) ‚Üí Lower threat score
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unknown process or script ‚Üí Raise threat score
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Determine user context
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Root or sudo ‚Üí Increase scrutiny
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unprivileged user ‚Üí Raise alert
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Compare file hash to known good baseline
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Matches ‚Üí Record & Continue
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Changed ‚Üí Flag + Alert MCP
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Take action based on cumulative threat score:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Low ‚Üí Log
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Medium ‚Üí Log + Flag
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ High ‚Üí Block operation + Alert MCP
This behavior allows the agent to detect configuration drift, suspicious patching, or even filesystem implants (e.g., malicious cronjobs or altered sshd_config).
Summary
Both agents follow the same philosophy:
    ‚Ä¢ Observe ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Escalate (if needed)
    ‚Ä¢ All decisions are traceable and repeatable
    ‚Ä¢ No ML guessing just structured, human legible logic
The MCP sees all flagged actions and either takes automated response (if policy allows) or alerts a human for final approval.
7. Design Philosophy: Use What Already Works
A foundational principle of this architecture is pragmatic reuse. The agents do not attempt to reimplement system level functions from scratch. Instead, they act as coordinators of existing tools wrapping, triggering, and learning from the output of well established utilities like nmap, netstat, iptables, psutil, inotify, auditctl, and others. This approach carries several critical advantages:
    ‚Ä¢ Trust Through Familiarity: Tools like nmap and iptables are widely audited, deeply understood, and actively maintained. Security professionals and system administrators already trust these utilities. By using them as is, agents inherit that trust. The system doesn‚Äôt obscure behavior behind a new black box it works in the open, with components people already know.
    ‚Ä¢ Auditability and Transparency: Using established binaries means behavior is easier to inspect and verify. Administrators can reproduce results outside of the agent system, validate decisions, and even override behavior with standard shell commands if needed.
    ‚Ä¢ Stability and Hardening: These tools have withstood decades of field testing and are hardened against misuse. Rewriting their functionality in custom code would introduce unnecessary risk and complexity.
    ‚Ä¢ Efficiency and Velocity: Development can focus on orchestration and learning, rather than low level implementation. This enables faster iteration and encourages community participation, especially in extending agent capabilities.
    ‚Ä¢ Compatibility: Existing logging, policy enforcement, and audit tools remain intact. The framework complements them, enhancing coordination rather than introducing conflicts.
In this architecture, agents function as composers, not soloists they determine what to ask, when to act, and how to decide, but rely on trusted system components to do the heavy lifting. This minimizes overhead while maximizing clarity and reliability.
8. Minimalist Agent Construction
The goal is not to replace the operating system it‚Äôs to watch it smarter.
Each agent is designed as a lightweight wrapper around the system tools and libraries already doing the heavy lifting. The prototype FileSentinel agent, for example, uses a combination of Python libraries (pyinotify, psutil, pwd) and OS native paths to observe real time file access across sensitive directories (/etc, /bin, /home, etc.).
This agent does no parsing from scratch. Instead:
    ‚Ä¢ It uses pyinotify to listen to kernel events (via inotify).
    ‚Ä¢ It queries system user info from pwd.getpwuid.
    ‚Ä¢ It examines open files and processes using psutil.
    ‚Ä¢ It logs activity into a rotating log with standard shutil and os.
Just by combining a few core libraries and file paths, it builds a fully functional sentinel one that is:
    ‚Ä¢ Fast, because it listens to the kernel directly.
    ‚Ä¢ Context aware, because it checks who did what, when, and from where.
    ‚Ä¢ Controllable, because it dynamically adjusts behavior via a whitelist (stored in /dev/.wl/whitelist.json) and critical path exemptions.
This design is repeatable across other agent types. Whether monitoring SSH sessions, firewall rule changes, unexpected outbound network spikes, or unauthorized binary execution, agents follow the same pattern:
Listen ‚ûù Analyze ‚ûù Decide ‚ûù Act ‚ûù Report
Each step leverages existing system capabilities tools like netstat, iptables, auditd, nmap, and the /proc filesystem with the agent simply coordinating them, making decisions, and feeding results upstream to the MCP.
No Reinvention, Just Coordination
This is not about rewriting auditd. It‚Äôs about noticing that auditd raised a flag at an odd hour, verifying the process behind it with psutil, and packaging the report for administrative review or action, if trust thresholds aren‚Äôt met.
By building agents this way, the framework remains:
    ‚Ä¢ Auditable ‚Äì admins can test behaviors independently.
    ‚Ä¢ Comprehensible ‚Äì nothing is hidden in opaque AC models.
    ‚Ä¢ Extendable ‚Äì anyone can add new agents, often with less than 200 lines of logic.
    ‚Ä¢ Efficient ‚Äì agents sleep when idle and only wake on relevant triggers.
    1. Case Study ‚Äì FileSentinel Agent (watcher.py)
(See code at:¬†https://github.com/TheHackersWorkshop/Watcher.py)
To demonstrate how agent behavior can be implemented without deep system hooks or machine learning dependencies, we present FileSentinel, a fully operational file access monitor. It watches key directories for modifications, deletions, or suspicious activity and logs relevant metadata for each event.
Rather than building a new file monitoring subsystem, FileSentinel makes use of battle tested components:
    ‚Ä¢ pyinotify for kernel level file event hooks via inotify
    ‚Ä¢ psutil for process and session information
    ‚Ä¢ pwd, os.stat, and standard libraries for resolving usernames, permissions, timestamps, and file states
It monitors key system directories like /etc, /bin, and /usr/bin, but also supports dynamic whitelisting to reduce alert fatigue.
Key Behaviors
The agent follows a defined lifecycle:
    ‚Ä¢ Detect file events via pyinotify
    ‚Ä¢ Evaluate actor identity and remote status using psutil and session data
    ‚Ä¢ Filter events using a debounce system and a user controlled regex whitelist (/dev/.wl/whitelist.json)
    ‚Ä¢ Log contextual information such as:
        ‚ó¶ Who triggered the change
        ‚ó¶ Whether the user was local or remote
        ‚ó¶ What process was involved
        ‚ó¶ File metadata (mtime, ctime, UID, size)
Trust by Design
The agent doesn‚Äôt require rootkit like powers or hidden logic. Everything is written in standard Python, with user editable whitelists and transparent behavior. This enables:
    ‚Ä¢ Auditing by administrators
    ‚Ä¢ Forking and adapting per environment
    ‚Ä¢ Compliance with air gapped or restricted environments
    ‚Ä¢ Predictable performance under load
Structure Summary

Why It Works
By relying on trusted, open source libraries and system call interfaces, this agent sidesteps the unpredictability and opacity of AC models while still providing intelligent, contextual insight into system activity.
The full agent script is maintained as a reference implementation and can be adapted or extended for related use cases (e.g., SSH session monitoring, /proc snooping, or config drift detection). It serves as a template for other agents in the system.
10. Master Control Program (MCP)
Despite its imposing name (a tongue in cheek nod to "Tron"), the Master Control Program (MCP) is not the decision maker it is a dashboard and broker. It does not analyze, does not predict, and does not interfere unless policy or an admin directs it to. The MCP acts as the nerve center, bridging the behavior of distributed agents with the human operator‚Äôs visibility and intent.
Core Functions
The MCP fulfills five core roles:
    1. Event Broker
    ‚Ä¢ Agents send structured event messages (e.g. JSON) to the MCP when a condition exceeds a threshold, breaks policy, or needs review.
    ‚Ä¢ The MCP timestamps and categorizes the event, then routes it to the correct interface log, notification, admin terminal, etc.
    ‚Ä¢ Events can include file diffs, process trees, behavioral scores, or just logs of activity.
    1. Policy Dispatch
    ‚Ä¢ The MCP stores and distributes security and operational policy to agents.
    ‚Ä¢ Example: "Allow maintenance logins from¬†10.1.1.0/24¬†after 9PM."
    ‚Ä¢ When policies change, they are versioned and pushed to agents as immutable documents agents do not guess or learn, they interpret policy.
    1. Admin Interface
    ‚Ä¢ Human operators interact with the system through the MCP‚Äôs interface CLI, GUI, or API.
    ‚Ä¢ Alerts, permission requests, logs, and graphs are routed here.
    ‚Ä¢ When agents encounter an ambiguous situation, the MCP relays the event and awaits a human decision (e.g., "Allow unusual SSH access?").
    1. Telemetry Aggregator
    ‚Ä¢ Though agents run independently, their behavior and reports converge here.
    ‚Ä¢ This allows the operator to review overall system health, agent status, anomaly heatmaps, threat scoring, and trends all without asking agents to communicate directly with one another.
    1. Wake and Sleep Controller
    ‚Ä¢ Resource usage is managed through event driven activation.
    ‚Ä¢ Most agents remain dormant until triggered. The MCP can wake agents by:
        ‚ó¶ Receiving a file change from a filesystem notifier.
        ‚ó¶ Seeing a spike in network behavior.
        ‚ó¶ Responding to a system level hook (e.g., sudo invocation).
    ‚Ä¢ Some agents remain always on (e.g., network monitors), but even these offload bulk work unless needed.
Behavioral Philosophy
The MCP does not override agents, nor does it attempt to outthink them. It is a command and control layer useful, auditable, but not essential to runtime defense. If the MCP goes down, agents continue to function based on last known good policy. If an agent goes rogue or crashes, the MCP will log its silence.
The architecture assumes partial degradation is expected resilience comes from independent agent operation, not central logic.
Example Interaction
A FileSentinel agent detects a modified /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
    1. File hash doesn‚Äôt match the baseline.
    2. Modified by a non root user using an unknown binary.
    3. Threat score: 8.5/10.
    4. The agent blocks further writes and sends the full report to the MCP.
    5. MCP raises a live alert to the admin console:
        ‚ó¶ ‚ÄúUnknown user 'jdoe' modified sshd_config from process /tmp/script. Action blocked. Approve, deny, or investigate?‚Äù
    6. Admin reviews, makes a decision. MCP relays it to the agent.
Summary
The MCP is not intelligent, but it is central:
    ‚Ä¢ It offers audit, orchestration, and human integration.
    ‚Ä¢ Agents do the work the MCP keeps the system visible, explainable, and manageable.
    ‚Ä¢ If agents are the immune system, the MCP is the brainstem, handling reflexes and communication, but not thought.
    1. Inter Agent Communication
In this system, agents are autonomous each one is a specialized actor responsible for monitoring or defending a specific domain (e.g., file changes, network behavior, user sessions). But in certain situations, cooperation between agents improves responsiveness, reduces duplication, and increases contextual awareness.
However, this is not a mesh network or a service bus. Inter agent communication follows a principle of necessity, with lightweight, ephemeral exchanges only when coordination is required.
Core Principles
    ‚Ä¢ Local first: Each agent is designed to make decisions with minimal external input.
    ‚Ä¢ Event driven: Agents only speak to each other when a triggering event explicitly justifies it.
    ‚Ä¢ No shared memory: Agents do not assume anything about another agent‚Äôs state.
    ‚Ä¢ Decentralized: There is no central broker or consensus model only ad hoc signaling.
Communication Channels
There are three main mechanisms through which agents interact:
11.1. MCP Mediated Messaging
    ‚Ä¢ Agents can request context from the MCP: ‚ÄúHas the NetWatch agent seen traffic from this IP before?‚Äù
    ‚Ä¢ MCP replies with known status or logs.
    ‚Ä¢ This maintains simplicity agents never talk to each other directly unless necessary.
11.2. Shared Event Buses (optional)
    ‚Ä¢ In higher performance builds, a lightweight local event bus (e.g. a ring buffer or UNIX socket) allows publish/subscribe behavior.
    ‚Ä¢ Example:
        ‚ó¶ FileSentinel detects a strange binary written to /tmp.
        ‚ó¶ It publishes: Event ‚Üí { type: 'new_executable', path: '/tmp/script', hash: 'abc123' }
        ‚ó¶ ProcWatcher, already watching new process launches, is listening.
        ‚ó¶ If that executable is run, ProcWatcher responds more quickly with richer context.
11.3. Shared Artifacts
    ‚Ä¢ Agents may write files to a temporary coordination folder (e.g., /dev/.wl/runtime/).
    ‚Ä¢ These files are time bound, self cleaning, and treated as disposable metadata drops.
    ‚Ä¢ Example:
        ‚ó¶ NetWatch drops a fingerprinted list of "interesting" IPs.
        ‚ó¶ DiskWatch references that when logging external drives being mounted.
Real World Example
Scenario: Suspicious Script Accessing Financial Files
    1. FileSentinel notices repeated access to /home/finance/reports/2025_q2.xlsx by a new script.
    2. The script was placed in /tmp unusual for production scripts.
    3. FileSentinel publishes:{ "event": "suspicious_file_access", "actor": "/tmp/extract.sh", }"target": "/home/finance/reports/2025_q2.xlsx", "score": 7.3
    4. NetWatch, already monitoring outgoing connections, flags:
        ‚ó¶ extract.sh¬†is initiating a slow upload to an unknown server.
        ‚ó¶ Alone, it might be a backup. Combined with FileSentinel‚Äôs report, it‚Äôs now a confirmed data exfiltration attempt.
    5. FirewallAgent receives escalation and blocks outbound IP.
    6. MCP alerts the admin with the chain of causality.
Summary
Agent to agent communication is:
    ‚Ä¢ Minimal, to avoid tight coupling.
    ‚Ä¢ Ephemeral, to avoid persistent complexity.
    ‚Ä¢ Contextual, based on observable system behavior, not assumptions.
This fosters a cooperative environment where agents can assist each other without forming hard dependencies a flexible, modular design that adapts well as new agents are added or removed.
12. Performance & Resource Budget
While the system is still in the design and prototyping stage, performance targets have been informed by the lightweight nature of behavior trees, the modular scope of each agent, and lessons from prior low overhead monitoring tools.
12.1 Design Goals (Aspirational Metrics)
These are not validated benchmarks, but targets for the initial implementation:
    ‚Ä¢ Per Agent Footprint: ~50‚ÄØMB RAM, <1% CPU during idle and typical operation
    ‚Ä¢ Runtime Overhead: Headless Unreal Engine runtime designed to stay under 1‚ÄØGB RAM and <5% CPU
    ‚Ä¢ Event Handling Latency: Targeting sub 5‚ÄØms response from trigger to tree execution
    ‚Ä¢ Scalability: Architecture is designed to support multiple concurrent agents on a single host, with distributed deployment possible across machines
12.2 GPU Acceleration: A Strategic Advantage
While the core system does not require GPU resources, Unreal Engine‚Äôs support for GPU compute opens doors for offloading non critical agent logic or simulation tasks. This can be strategically leveraged in high load systems where CPU cycles must be reserved for real time workloads.
Examples:
    ‚Ä¢ Offloading visualization, replay, or simulation workloads (e.g., log replays for debugging)
    ‚Ä¢ Running complex tree branches in GPU parallelized environments for burst processing
    ‚Ä¢ Isolating analytics or reporting functions from CPU bound monitoring
This GPU aware design ensures that Guardian AC remains a non intrusive layer, preserving the host system's primary performance envelope.
12.3 Planned Benchmarking
As implementation proceeds, formal benchmarking of CPU, RAM, and I/O impact will be conducted. These will include:
    ‚Ä¢ Agent idle and active monitoring load
    ‚Ä¢ Behavior tree execution latency
    ‚Ä¢ Cross agent orchestration costs under scale
    ‚Ä¢ Resource profile under both CPU only and GPU accelerated conditions
    1. Call to Build
This document is a blueprint and an open invitation, not a finished product. It outlines a bold new approach to system monitoring one designed for transparency, efficiency, and community collaboration.
The core framework is ready for development, but the journey ahead requires a dedicated team or community to take it forward. Due to other commitments and the scale of this project, I am releasing this blueprint freely, with no accompanying code or official repository at this time.
The intent is simple: to empower innovators, developers, and security experts worldwide to build, expand, and refine this vision. Whether you contribute code, concepts, testing, or practical implementations, your input will shape the future of this project.
I encourage sharing this blueprint openly on LinkedIn, Reddit, or any platform to spark discussion and attract collaborators. The technology and ideas here are yours to advance and adapt under an open, inclusive ethos.
This is a call to the community: take the blueprint, build the system, and lead the way toward a more secure, accountable, and intelligent monitoring landscape
14. Conclusion
By the time most systems raise an alert, the damage is already done.
The database is gone. The ransomware is in place. The threat has moved on.
This blueprint is about breaking that cycle.
It‚Äôs not just another monitoring concept it‚Äôs a real time, behavior driven system built for action before the breach, not analysis after it. Agents that respond in milliseconds. A control plane that respects human oversight. Tooling that‚Äôs fast, explainable, and rooted in what already works.
We live on networks under constant pressure from bots, from zero days, from attackers who never sleep. Our defenses should be just as persistent. Just as adaptive. Just as alive.
This isn‚Äôt a startup pitch or a stealth beta. It‚Äôs a blueprint dropped into the public domain designed to be picked up, shaped, and deployed by the community.
There‚Äôs no code to clone. No team to join.
Just a starting point, and the challenge: build the thing that should already exist.
Because detection delayed is security denied.
And the right time to change is now.
